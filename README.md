# Fantasy League

This README will be more of a thinking out loud document until I manage to
get something that others can actually use. Ideas are welcome, always, but
may not necessarily be adopted. However, where they are adopted, credit is
definitely going to be given.

## Components
What do I need to build a fantasy league engine?

- Backend
  - player achievement tracker
  - points system for each achievement
  - player value algorithm for each game round
  - account management

- UI
  - team management
  - player info
  - league status
  - user info
